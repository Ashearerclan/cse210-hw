Common built-in variable types are:

int - Integers (whole numbers, positive and negative)

string - Strings (a sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, or symbols)

float - Floating point numbers (numbers that use decimals)

double - Double precision floating point numbers (just like a float, except it takes up 
twice as much memory, so it can hold larger numbers or numbers with more decimal places)

bool - Boolean variables (true or false)


Input and Output

In C#, to print, or write something as output to the console, 
you use the Console.WriteLine("") function.

Python

color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

C#

Console.Write("What is your favorite color? ");
string color = Console.ReadLine();


String Interpolation
In C#, if you would like to use a variable inside a string,
you start the string with a dollar sign $ in the same way that in Python,
you start a format string with an f.

Python

school = "BYU-Idaho"
print(f"I am studying at {school}.")

C#

string school = "BYU-Idaho";
Console.WriteLine($"I am studying at {school}.");
